# About me :man_technologist:
I am currently engaged in the pursuit of acquiring knowledge and skills in the field of programming. The projects that have been uploaded are solely for the purpose of learning, both for my personal reference and to assist others. Some of the projects are exclusively for my own use, while others are related to coursework from my programming degree program and from 42 Madrid, where I am currently enrolled as a student.
